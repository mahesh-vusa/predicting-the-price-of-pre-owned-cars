Predicting the price of pre-owned cars
        Abstract
In this project I built a simple machine learning model called linear regression model and random forest regression model in order to predict the price of pre-owned cars for a given data set. The price of the car varies on different features like year of registration; power, kilometers travelled, model of the car, fuel type etc.

Introduction: The second hand cars in the market are abundant and not everyone are able to buy first hand cars, a company wanted to sell the pre-owned cars and wanted an website for the customers who wanted to sell and buy car needed an machine learning model to predict the price to sell and buy depending on the different features like age, power, vehicle type, kilometers travelled, model of the car, type of gear fuel type etc.

Target set: price of the car

Features set: year of registration, power, Model of the car, gear box type, vehicle type, fuel type and kilometers travelled etc.
